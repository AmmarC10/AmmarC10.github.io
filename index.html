        <p class = "head">Hello World, my name is Ammar and I am currently looking for my first internship as a Computer Science student. Computer science is something
          that I always knew I wanted to get into from a young age. It started when I decided that I wanted to design video games, because of this
          I took some Computer Science courses through highschool and realized how much I enjoy coding. This year my goal has been to work my 
          hardest and learn as many things as possible to help me get an internship for the summer. This website I designed goes over the projects I
          have created and skills I have learned the past few years.

            <h3>Bingo - C & Shell Script</h3>
            <p>This project was a group assignment for my Introduction to Unix and C course. This project was assigned twice, once with C and another time with 
              Shell Script. The project required us to use linked lists, Random,
              branching, and looping to create and error check the project. The program needs one input file to run which contains the seed number 
              as the first line and the rest being a properly spaced bingo card. Good input and bad input files are provided in the link to view code.

            <h3>CRUD App - React.js, Node.js, MySQL</h3>
            <p>This project was created using React.jsn Node.js, and MySQL with basic CSS as emphasis was more on the backend work. It is a simple CRUD 
              application that allows you to add a new item with it's name, cost, and date. You can also delete an item or update an items cost that exists in the database.

            <h3>Flight Reservation System - Java</h3>
            <p> This project is a Flight Reservation System which allows you to reserve your seat on whichever flight
              you desire from the flights.txt. It requires your own personal information such as name and passport and what seat you would like. It will 
              update that seat to show that it is taken and you may remove your reservation too if you like. This project uses heavy object-oriented programming
              alongside branching,sets, maps, interfaces, loops, arrays, etc.
